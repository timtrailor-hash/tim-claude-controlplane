# rename_guard.sh — PreToolUse hook that catches destructive rename/removal
# operations and refuses them if references to the old path still exist.
#
# Addresses Pattern 19 (partial grep before rename): tonight I renamed a
# memory clone without grepping for every consumer. This hook makes that
# grep mandatory BEFORE the destructive operation runs.
#
# What it blocks:
#   - `rm -rf <dir>`
#   - `rm <file>` for files inside ~/code, ~/.claude, tim-claude-controlplane
#   - `mv <src> <dst>` where src is under a managed directory
#   - `git mv <src> <dst>`
#
# Escape hatch: append ` # verified: <pattern>` to the command. The hook
# extracts <pattern>, greps both machines for it, and passes if matches is
# empty OR the commit contains the matches as expected fixups.
#
# Mode:
#   RENAME_GUARD_MODE=advisory (default): warn to stderr, exit 0 (allow)
#   RENAME_GUARD_MODE=strict: exit 2 (block) on any unverified rename
#
# Reads JSON from stdin per Claude Code hook protocol.
