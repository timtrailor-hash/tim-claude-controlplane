# SessionStart hook: validate that every hook script and MCP launcher
# referenced in settings.json actually exists and is executable.
#
# Why: today's review found 3 hook scripts referenced in settings.json that
# didn't exist on disk (pre-existing drift). This catches that class of bug
# at session start, before broken hooks fail silently for weeks.
#
# Behaviour: writes a report to /tmp/claude_hook_validation.log and to
# ~/.claude/hook_validation.log on every session start. Sends an ntfy
# notification if anything is missing. Exits 0 always — advisory.
