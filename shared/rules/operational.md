# Operational Rules

## Plan Mode Triggers
Enter plan mode (write out the plan, confirm before implementing) for:
- Any change to daemons, LaunchAgents, or automated processes
- Any change to printer configuration or macros
- Any new infrastructure (services, scheduled tasks, monitoring)
- Any refactor touching 3+ files or architectural decisions
- Any task where getting it wrong has blast radius (data loss, print kill, service outage)

Skip plan mode for: reading/researching, simple file edits, iOS UI changes, memory updates.

**If something goes wrong mid-execution: STOP and re-plan. Don't push forward.**

## Before Saying "I Can't" — Mandatory Checklist
Before telling Tim something can't be done, or asking him to do something himself, run this checklist:
1. Check `memory/topics/` for prior work on this topic
2. Search session JSONL logs for keywords (memory MCP `search_exact`)
3. Check if the tool/file/path actually exists right now (don't assume from memory)
4. Attempt the simplest version first
5. Can I SSH to Mac Mini and do it there? (`ssh timtrailor@100.126.253.40`)
6. Can I use a tool I haven't tried yet?

If still stuck after the checklist: say "I tried X and got Y" — never just "I can't".

This checklist is the only piece of "default to action" preserved from the prior version of this file. It exists because the old "default to action" rule was being misinterpreted as licence to act without thinking. Plan mode is the new default; this checklist is the safety valve against learned helplessness.

## Pre-Flight Checklist (before shipping any daemon/automation)
1. What commands can this code send to external systems? List every one.
2. Does it check state before every action? (print_stats.state for printer, health for services)
3. What happens on network drop, error state, or unexpected input?
4. Can Tim stop it with a single command?
5. Has this category of fix been attempted before? (check `lessons.md`)
If ANY answer is "I don't know" — don't ship it.

## Verification Standard
Never mark a task complete without proving it works END-TO-END:
- Don't just check "is the process running?" — check "does the feature actually work?"
- For API features: make an actual API call and verify the response
- For printer features: query actual printer state via Moonraker
- For iOS builds: verify the .app was produced and signed
- For daemon changes: check logs show correct behaviour, not just "running"

## Plan Mode Review Agents
When in plan mode, spawn at least one independent review agent to challenge the plan before implementation. The review agent's job: verify factual claims against memory files and live system state.

## Network/Infrastructure Change Verification
Before any commit that changes an IP address, hostname, port, or network configuration:
1. Verify the current working value by querying the live system (not from memory alone)
2. Check MEMORY.md and user_profile.md for device capabilities
3. Test from the AFFECTED context — if the change affects remote access, verify remotely
4. Spawn a review agent to fact-check the change against memory files and live state
5. If the change reverts a previous value, find the commit that set it and understand WHY

## Memory query shapes

When searching my own memory (MCP `search_memory`, `search_exact`, or
`/deep-context`), pick the tool that matches the query shape:

- **Exploration** ("have we touched this area?") → `search_memory`
  (ChromaDB semantic). Returns loosely related sessions; good for
  surfacing the neighbourhood.
- **Retrieval** ("what exactly did we decide about X?") →
  `search_exact` (FTS5) when the query contains an identifier (path,
  commit SHA, IP, error string). Exact matches beat semantic neighbours
  for this shape.
- **Synthesis** ("why does this pattern keep failing?") →
  `/deep-context --synthesise`. Single searches cannot produce the
  cross-session synthesis this shape needs. Do not try to answer
  synthesis questions with `search_memory`.

A recurring failure mode is asking a synthesis question and accepting
the first semantic-search result as the answer. The answer will look
plausible and be incomplete.

## Why-did-this-regress pattern

When a test breaks, a daemon fails, or a fix stops working, the first
move is `/deep-context` with a brief shaped as "X has broken before;
current symptom is Y; what has been tried and why did each attempt
fail". Diagnose from the synthesis, not from scratch. This was the
pattern that caught the prompt-button root cause on 2026-04-23 after
five prior fixes had all patched the wrong substrate.

## Topics are the only curated layer

`memory/topics/*.md` are hand-maintained truth. Every other artefact
(ChromaDB index, FTS5 index, prestripped corpus, compressed session
summaries if any) is derived and can be regenerated from raw JSONL
plus topics. When a derived artefact drifts, regenerate it; do not
hand-edit it. Hand-editing a derived artefact creates state that
cannot be replayed and will drift again.

## Raw session transcripts are archived forever

The `*.jsonl` files under `~/.claude/projects/` are the source of
truth. They are not compressed, summarised for storage, or deleted.
Any "tidy up old sessions" instinct is wrong. Storage is cheap,
model readers are abundant, and future synthesis depends on having
the full history available.

## RCA Depth Standard
When conducting any Root Cause Analysis, ALWAYS analyse all layers:
1. **What happened** — sequence of events, immediate cause
2. **What controls existed** — list every rule, check, or enforcement that should have prevented it
3. **Why each control failed** — for each, explain specifically why it didn't fire
4. **Fix classification** — is the proposed fix technical enforcement or another text rule? If text rule, explain why it will succeed where previous rules didn't
5. **Control class** — known-known (agent knew but skipped), unknown-known (rule exists but unconsulted), or unknown-unknown (nobody knew the action was dangerous)
An RCA that only covers layer 1 is incomplete.
