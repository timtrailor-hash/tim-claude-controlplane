# /debate — iterative three-way debate until convergence

Where `/review` runs Gemini and ChatGPT in parallel ONCE and presents both verdicts, `/debate` runs **all three models** (Claude Opus, Gemini, ChatGPT) through **multiple rounds**, where each sees the other two's previous reasoning and updates their position, until they converge on a single verdict (or hit the max-rounds cap).

**Claude Opus participates directly** — the orchestrating session (which is already Opus on subscription) forms and defends its own position each round. No Opus API credits are spent. Gemini and ChatGPT are called via API in the Python script.

This is the right tool for irreversible decisions: architecture changes, daemon designs, deployments to production, anything where being wrong is expensive.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`:
- The scope to review (file path, diff range, "the last commit", "the printer hook plan", etc.)
- `+full` — force full models (Opus + gpt-5.4 + gemini-2.5-pro). Default for `/debate`.
- `+mini` — use mini models (Opus + gpt-5.4-mini + gemini-2.5-flash). Claude is always Opus regardless.
- `+rounds=N` — max rounds before forced termination (default 4)

Note: `/debate` defaults to **full models** because the whole point is high-stakes decisions. Use `+mini` only if you're testing the workflow itself.

## Pipeline

```
ROUND 0 (blind — anti-anchoring):
  All three form positions independently. NO model sees any other's response.
  claude  → verdict_cl0, reasoning_cl0  (Opus writes to file)
  gemini  → verdict_g0, reasoning_g0    (API, context only — no other positions)
  chatgpt → verdict_c0, reasoning_c0   (API, context only — no other positions)
  
  All positions revealed simultaneously.

if all 3 agree: DONE — unanimous on round 0 (true independent convergence)
if 2/3 agree: DONE — majority verdict (note the dissent)
else continue:

ROUND 1 (informed — the debate begins):
  Each model sees ALL THREE round-0 positions and must engage with them.
  claude  → verdict_cl1 (sees Gemini R0 + ChatGPT R0)
  gemini  → verdict_g1  (sees Claude R0 + ChatGPT R0)
  chatgpt → verdict_c1  (sees Claude R0 + Gemini R0)

if all 3 agree: DONE — unanimous
if 2/3 agree: DONE — majority verdict (note dissent)
else round 2, round 3, ...

If max rounds hit without convergence:
  Return ALL THREE final positions, mark as STUCK, escalate to Tim
```

**Anti-anchoring design**: Round 0 is blind. Gemini and ChatGPT receive ONLY the context — not Claude's position. Claude writes its position to file but the script does NOT read it. All three positions are revealed simultaneously after Round 0 completes. The debate (with cross-model visibility) starts at Round 1.

## Steps

### 1. Gather context once

Read the artifacts. Build a base prompt that includes:
- What the work is and why
- The actual diff / code / decision

Save to `/tmp/debate_context.md`.

### 2. Round 0 — blind independent positions (anti-anchoring)

All three models form positions from context alone. No model sees any other's response.

**2a. Run Gemini + ChatGPT FIRST** (via the script with `DEBATE_ROUND=0`). They receive ONLY the context — no Claude position.

**2b. Form YOUR position** — write to `/tmp/debate_claude_r0.md`. You must NOT read Gemini's or ChatGPT's Round 0 responses before writing yours. Form your view from the context alone:
- Identify the most important issues (security, correctness, drift, printer-safety)
- Defend your position with 1-3 specific technical points
- End with: `VERDICT: APPROVE | CHANGES REQUESTED | BLOCK`
- Aim for 200-400 words

**2c. NOW read all three positions** — reveal simultaneously. Check convergence.

### 3. Run Gemini + ChatGPT rounds

Save and run `/tmp/debate_round.py`. In Round 0, the script sends ONLY context (no Claude position). In Round 1+, it sends all previous positions.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Run one round of /debate for Gemini + ChatGPT.
Claude (Opus) participates directly from the orchestrating session — not via API.
This script handles only the two external API calls.

Round 0 (blind): Gemini and ChatGPT see ONLY context — no Claude position.
Round 1+: Each model sees all others' previous positions."""

### 4. Debate loop (orchestrated by you, the Opus session)

Run this loop manually — YOU are the third debater, not a passive orchestrator:

**Round 0 (blind — all three independent):**
1. Run Gemini + ChatGPT blind: `DEBATE_ROUND=0 DEBATE_TIER=full python3 /tmp/debate_round.py`
2. Write YOUR blind position to `/tmp/debate_claude_r0.md` — do NOT read the Gemini/ChatGPT files first
3. NOW read all three Round 0 positions. Check convergence.

**Round 1+ (informed — the actual debate):**
1. Read all three previous-round positions. Genuinely consider their arguments.
2. Write your updated position to `/tmp/debate_claude_r{N}.md`. If others raised valid points, change your verdict.
3. Run: `DEBATE_ROUND={N} DEBATE_TIER=full python3 /tmp/debate_round.py`
4. Read results. Check convergence. If unanimous or 2/3 majority, stop.
5. If max rounds hit without convergence: present all three final positions and escalate to Tim.

### 5. Synthesize for Tim

After the script finishes, present:
```
=== /debate report ===
Scope: <files>
Tier: full | mini
Rounds: <N>

UNANIMOUS on round <N>: APPROVE | CHANGES REQUESTED | BLOCK
  -- or --
MAJORITY on round <N>: <verdict> (dissent from <model>)
  -- or --
NOT CONVERGED after <N> rounds — escalating to Tim
  Claude final:  <X>
  Gemini final:  <Y>
  ChatGPT final: <Z>

KEY POINTS (from final round):
- <bullet from Claude>
- <bullet from Gemini>
- <bullet from ChatGPT>

ACTION: <what to do next>
```

## Cost notes

`/debate` costs less than you'd expect because Claude Opus participates for free (subscription):
- mini, 2 rounds: ~$0.10 (only Gemini Flash + GPT-5.4-mini via API)
- mini, 4 rounds: ~$0.20
- full, 2 rounds: ~$0.30 (only Gemini Pro + GPT-5.4 via API)
- full, 4 rounds: ~$0.60

Use it for decisions worth that. For routine pre-commit checks, stick with `/review`.

## Termination conditions

The loop terminates when:
1. **Unanimous**: all three reviewers return the same verdict
2. **Majority**: two of three agree (the dissenter's reasoning is noted)
3. **Max rounds**: hit `MAX_ROUNDS` without even a majority — escalate to Tim with all three final positions
4. **API failure**: if any API errors twice in a row, terminate and report

## Important

- This is a THREE-WAY DEBATE, not a vote. All three models (Claude Opus, Gemini, ChatGPT) see each other's reasoning and update accordingly. The output is a converged verdict (unanimous or 2/3 majority) or escalation.
- **Claude Opus participates DIRECTLY** — you (the orchestrating session) ARE the Claude debater. You form your own position, write it to file, read the others' responses, and genuinely update your view each round. This gives the best possible Claude reasoning at zero API cost.
- **Round 0 is BLIND** — you must write your position BEFORE reading Gemini's or ChatGPT's. This eliminates anchoring bias. The debate (with visibility) starts at Round 1.
- Be honest in the debate. If Gemini or ChatGPT raise a valid point, change your verdict. The whole point is that three perspectives are better than one.
- Use VERDICT lines so convergence detection works. The system prompt instructs Gemini and ChatGPT to end with one. You must also end your response file with one.
- Three different training regimes (Anthropic RLHF, Google RLHF, OpenAI RLHF) means genuinely independent perspectives.
- Pair with `/review` not as replacement: `/review` for every commit, `/debate` for the once-a-week architectural decisions.
