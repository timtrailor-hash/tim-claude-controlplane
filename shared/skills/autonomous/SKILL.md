# Autonomous Task Runner

## MANDATORY TRIGGER — READ THIS FIRST

**You MUST use this runner whenever Tim says ANY of these (or similar):**
- "email me" / "email me when done" / "send me an email" / "ping me" / "let me know"
- "I'm stepping away" / "I'm going to bed" / "going out" / "back later" / "logging off" / "heading off"
- "do this independently" / "work on this while I'm away"
- /autonomous

**Do NOT just do the work inline and send a simple email.** The runner guarantees delivery even if this session dies. Every autonomous task MUST go through this runner.

**The runner emails the ACTUAL RESULT — not "task complete".** Tim gets the real answer in his inbox.

## How It Works

1. You reformulate Tim's request into a self-contained prompt
2. The runner script launches with `nohup` — completely independent of this session
3. It runs `claude -p "prompt"` non-interactively (same tools, same CLAUDE.md, same memory)
4. If Claude fails, times out, or produces garbage → it retries with exponential backoff (up to 5 times)
5. On success → emails the ACTUAL RESULT
6. On all retries exhausted → emails failure report with all attempt outputs
7. Email delivery itself retries 5 times — the email ALWAYS arrives

## Instructions

When Tim triggers autonomous mode:

### Step 1: Reformulate the prompt

Turn Tim's conversational request into a **complete, self-contained prompt** that a fresh Claude session can execute without any conversation context. Include:
- What to do (specific, actionable)
- What tools/files/paths to use
- What format the output should be in
- Any constraints or preferences from this conversation

**Critical:** The prompt must be self-contained. The runner launches a FRESH Claude session — it has CLAUDE.md and memory but NOT this conversation's context.

### Step 2: Write and launch the runner

```bash
nohup python3 ~/.claude/skills/autonomous/autonomous_runner.py \
  --prompt "THE COMPLETE SELF-CONTAINED PROMPT HERE" \
  --email "timtrailor@gmail.com" \
  --max-retries 5 \
  --timeout 600 \
  > /tmp/autonomous_runner_stdout.log 2>&1 &
```

### Step 3: Confirm to Tim

Tell Tim:
- The task is running independently (PID shown in log)
- It will retry up to 5 times if needed
- He WILL get an email with the actual result
- Log file: `/tmp/autonomous_runner.log`
- If something goes catastrophically wrong, result saved to `/tmp/autonomous_result.txt`

## Example

Tim says: "Review all our printer configs and email me a summary of what needs fixing. I'm going to bed."

You would run:
```bash
nohup python3 ~/.claude/skills/autonomous/autonomous_runner.py \
  --prompt "You are reviewing the 3D printer setup for Tim. SSH to the Sovol SV08 Max at 192.168.0.108 (user: sovol, password: sovol) and review the Klipper config files in /home/sovol/printer_data/config/. Also check the Moonraker API at http://192.168.0.108:7125/printer/objects/query?print_stats&extruder&heater_bed for current state. Compare configs against best practices. Check for: deprecated settings, missing safety guards, calibration issues, unused includes. Format your response as a clear summary with sections: Current State, Issues Found, Recommended Fixes. Be specific — include file paths and line numbers." \
  --email "timtrailor@gmail.com" \
  --max-retries 5 \
  --timeout 600 \
  > /tmp/autonomous_runner_stdout.log 2>&1 &
```

## Monitoring

The runner creates `/tmp/autonomous_task_active` while running (contains PID, start time, prompt preview).
Check progress: `tail -f /tmp/autonomous_runner.log`
Check if running: `cat /tmp/autonomous_task_active 2>/dev/null`

## Important Notes

- The runner uses `claude -p` (non-interactive) — same model, same tools, same CLAUDE.md/memory
- It strips ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the environment (uses subscription auth, no API costs)
- Each retry gets a fresh Claude session with full context budget
- Exponential backoff: 30s → 60s → 120s → 240s → 300s between retries
- Default timeout: 10 minutes per attempt. For very long tasks, use `--timeout 1800` (30 min)
- The RESULT is emailed, not just "done" — Tim gets the actual answer
