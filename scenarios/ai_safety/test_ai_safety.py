"""AI-specific safety scenarios.

Added 2026-04-21 after memory poisoning research (Cisco) and MCP STDIO
vulnerability (OX Security). These tests close the class of gap traditional
pen-testing misses.

Design property 1: memory retrieval returns via tool-call results, never via
system-prompt injection. Defends against Cisco-class memory poisoning.

Design property 2: MCP servers installed from npm registries are version-pinned.
Defends against silent supply-chain drift.

Design property 3: no code path in the tree promotes retrieved content into the
system message role. If this test fails a session could be poisoned by a
planted memory entry.
